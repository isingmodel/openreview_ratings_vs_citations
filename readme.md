## TODO
* Data Analysis






## Trouble shooting
* If you cannot load pickle data files, update python or pandas version to read higher protocol version of pickle file. 


## Ideas
* Papers with an average rating of less than 6 may have to be excluded from the analysis because the intention of the Program Chairs is relatively reflected. (rating 6: marginally above the acceptance threshold)
